														<p class="i2">Led by recognised sustainability expert and author Adrian Hodges, AHA’s work is driven by the belief that by considering business goals and societal issues together rather than apart, solutions can be created to benefit both business and society.</p>

AHA support help clients access new consumer and customer insights, new market opportunities and new business partners.</p>

													<h3>Our Beliefs</h3>
												</div>
											</div>
											<div class="i2">
												<div class="group heading d4" style="display: block;">
													<h4>The role of business in society</h4>
												</div>
												<div class="group text i1 d3">
													<p>The fact that business is the principal engine for growth and economic development is not contested. Whether that growth is sustainable or unsustainable and whether the costs and benefits are equally shared is however rightly hotly debated.</p>
													<p>At AHA Ltd we believe that many firms do - but more firms could - contribute to sustainable growth and equitable development. The private sector has capabilities and competences which, when utilised alongside complementary skills and resources from other sectors, can help address some of the world’s seemingly most intractable societal challenges.</p>
												</div>
											</div>
											<div class="i3">
												<div class="group quote i1 d3">
													<q>Ask not just what your business can do for Sustainability, but also what Sustainability can do for your business</q>
												</div>
											</div>
											<div class="i4">
                                                						<div class="group heading d4" style="display: block;">
													<h4>Value Creation</h4>
												</div>
												<div class="group text i1 d4">
													<p>We work to demonstrate that it is in the enlightened self-interest of companies to seek ways in which to make a difference, as addressing key societal challenges reduces barriers to reaching new markets and generates insights for innovative new products and services. By pro-actively managing social and environmental risks and capitalising on associated opportunities, firms create corporate competitive advantage and value for society.</p>

                                                    <p>The current global economic climate puts an increasing pressure on family incomes and personal finances as well as the performance of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), which form the majority of the corporate sector in most markets. The need for ready access to safe and affordable financial services has never been greater for personal and business customers.</p>
													<p>Following the financial crisis and a number of events damaging to the firm's reputation, a well known Global Financial Services Company made a renewed commitment to be a leading global corporate citizen. AHA Ltd was brought in to provide support in the development of a re-freshed and modernised CSR and Sustainability strategy moving from traditional philanthropy to the development of innovative products and services with substantive social impact.</p>
													<p>Assigned work included: reviewing current processes and CSR management across units and markets; mentoring senior executives; scoping and benchmarking activities; facilitating inter-company workshops to identifying opportunities to enhance business impact and create social value; supporting the implementation of selected activities.</p>

													<h4>Conception and Facilitation of a B2B Partnership</h4>
												</div>
												<div class="group text i2 d3">
													<p>Barclays and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) have recently announced an investment of c£7 million in a pioneering 3-year partnership to increase access to affordable healthcare and medicines for people in Africa, piloting in Zambia, while helping to create improved economic conditions for growth. The Partnership aims to positively impact 1 million Zambian citizens whilst building Barclays and GSK businesses.</p>
													<p>AHA Ltd helped conceive the initiative, brokered the inter-company relationship and supported the design and development phase, arguing that by combining complimentary skills and expertise two influential MNCs can help remove financial barriers to healthcare access, while supporting small business development and job creation; and demonstrating how a collaboration would leverage additional resources and support for Barclays and GSK Africa's commercial objectives and business development goals.</p>
													<p>Assigned work included: making the business and social case for a B2B collaboration from companies from different industry sectors; identifying areas of shared interest along respective value chains; scoping potential 'sweet spots' and intervention options; proposing governance, legal and financial frameworks; facilitating inter-company dialogue and operational teams; scoping and engaging with additional delivery partners and funders; mapping stakeholders and engagement strategies; creating thought-leadership activities; proposing measurement and evaluation approaches.</p>

											<div class="i3">
												<div class="group quote i1 d3">
													<p>Sir Andrew Witty, CEO of GSK said: <q>Though prospects for growth are improving, Zambia still experiences significant healthcare challenges. By combining our specific resources and skills with those of Barclays, we can help unblock financial barriers and enhance government efforts to help increase access to affordable healthcare. Good health is vital for people to live more productive lives, which in turn will help to create the right conditions for Zambia’s economic development and lead to a more prosperous society.</q></p>
												</div>
												<div class="group quote i2 d3">
													<p>Antony Jenkins, Barclays Group Chief Executive, said: <q>Sustainable economic development and the growth of our businesses in Africa is intrinsically linked to the wellbeing of the communities in which we operate: healthy communities lead to healthy markets. We want to use our core business activities to address societal challenges systematically but we know we can't achieve this alone. We are extremely pleased to be working with GSK.</q></p>

                                                    <p>Investing in women’s economic empowerment is increasingly viewed as a powerful way to advance women's rights and spur global economic growth.  Failure to act is recognised as a drag on gender equality and economic development.  At a firm level, there is a growing understanding of the contribution women make in vital roles along extended value chains, whether as suppliers and producers, employees or managers, and in retail and marketing fields.  Some companies have publicly made the advancement of women’s rights and economic inclusion in their operations and global supply chains a business priority.</p>
                                                    <p>AHA Ltd was brought in by a leading FMCG company to support the development of the firm’s global women’s economic empowerment strategy and provide advice on aligning related company wide policies and practices with business goals and societal need. </p>
													<p>Assigned work included: supporting leadership in reviewing women's empowerment ‘touch-points’ and related initiatives across business functions, markets and brands; scoping and mapping women’s access to rights and safety, skills and training and economic opportunity in different settings; drafting a firm wide thematic strategic narrative; identifying credible organisations for stakeholder engagement and alliances; creating a women's empowerment programme guidebook and associated toolkit for internal functions; facilitating internal workshops and external stakeholder workshop to identify shared value opportunities and validate approaches to impact measurement and evaluation. </p>

If done well, this can create a richer, more meaningful connection with the consumer.  Some firms are pioneering a next level of association between brand and social purpose by embedding a 'social mission' into the brand's DNA and actively investing in brand activation programmes that have a measurable impact on societal challenges. </p>
													<p>AHA Ltd was invited to work with a leading FMCG company to support a number of brands in homecare and personal care categories to scope appropriate social mission territories and to advise on impactful programmatic activity in key activation markets. </p>
													<p>Assigned work included: High level mapping of target consumer experiences in relation to identified social issues, both globally and in key markets; conceiving and developing intervention possibilities; identifying leading authorities, partners and experts in selected intervention areas; facilitating co-creation workshops with partner organisations; developing programme options including delivery models, business case rationale, social impact metrics, etc; liaising with brand communications agencies on development of related brand communications campaigns to build brand equity.</p>
